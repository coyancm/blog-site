description: A collection of real estate photography by Cameron Coyan.

A collection of real estate photography I've taken and edited over the years. The majority of these were shot in Hilton Head on a Nikon d3300 with a 12mm lens and 5 brackets. My more modern photos are taken on a Sony a7r iii with a 24-105mm lens with 3 brackets. Editing done in Photomatix Pro, Lightroom and Photoshop.
